## Tableau Dashboard: Squirrel-Viewing Guide to NYC Parks
[Link](https://public.tableau.com/views/Squirrel-ViewingNYCParkGuide/SquirrelViewingGuide)
This dashboard focuses on answering three questions that may be relevant to park visitors who want to check out some wild city squirrels: 
1. _where can I see the most squirrels?_
Relevant metrics: raw number of squirrels observed at park; squirrel to acre ratio
2. _where can I come close to the squirrels?_ 
Relevant metrics: squirrel curiosity score (% of squirrels at park that would approach a human); squirrel approchability score (% of squirrels that are either indifferent or approaching humans)
3. _where can I see squirrels in colors other than gray?_
Relevan metrics: % of non-gray squirrels
